### Overview 
This is simple API using node js and express framework. On this this API I used block api, I can fetch my GET, POST, and PUT end points. 
I didn't use third party packages like sequelize, mongoose or firebase etc to iteract with database. I just created hard coded  contacts, then have an array to store objects.

### Features

- GET all users
- GET user by name
- PUT update current user
- POST add new user
